FractionalArithmetic

FractionalArithmetic was written to support woodworking when using fractional inches and not millimeters.
There is a smallest unit of fractional arithmetic that woodworkers are used to working with, in my case
it is 1/32".  If I make my default base 32, then all computations requiring a final result to be reported
as a nearest fraction will result in a dimension of 1/32" or greater.  So when I set up a machine to conduct
an operation I know the accuracy I should be dialing in.

The fractional arithmetic basis for numerical calculation was carried forward into
a woodworking graphics module for displaying designs and options for a project.
Fractional arithmetic provides a new class of number called MF for MixedFraction.


Although Google Sketchup provides a marvelous graphics tool it requires a learning curve 
and doing it their way.  In my case I wanted a graphics tool that was able to follow
the design as I think of building it.  So part A connects to part B at the lower right corner is
more intuitive in my case than mousing around.  I have used Drawingboard by Ashlum for some years
and found it practical but difficult to setup and change once a drawing scale is established.
I wanted a drawing program that figures out the correct scale and allows a text based
input of dimensions and connections instead of a GUI requiring mouse clicks at a precise location.

I selected RMagick as the graphics support for my Ruby modules. I think RMagick provides
excellent and reliable utilities to interact with Imagemagick and is relatively fast when
rendering a project.
